# CHANGELOG

V 0.1 --------
created basic python module setup
added support for external modules WARNING INSECURE
added password hashing (with salt)


Basic program flow as follows:

main.py runs in background, triggers auth.py on three-stroke keypress
auth asks for password, checks against stored hash + salt (loads salt from file) (neither provided)
if fails, kills itself and back to desktop
if successful, kill self after triggering opening of term.py

term.py loads modules using modulepointer.py


current commands:
None.
